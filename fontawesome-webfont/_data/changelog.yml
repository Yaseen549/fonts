  title: Replaced the "staging area" with automatic bidirectional sync
  date: 2018-05-29
  description: |
    Previously, Beaker gave every Dat archive a "staging area" where users could preview files before publishing them.
    We found this created complex edge-cases, and so replaced it with an automatic bidirectional sync with the folder.
